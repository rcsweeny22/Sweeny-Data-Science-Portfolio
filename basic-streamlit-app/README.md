# This is my Data Science streamlit app!
- This app will be interactive and an opportunity for individuals to engage with my code in an exciting way.
- I will offer some filtering options that allow my audience to interact with the sample DataFrame I chose to work with, which is Palmer's Penguins.

# Instructions:
- In order to run the streamlit app, you must go to your Terminal in VS Code and type in: streamlit run basic_streamlit_app/main.py
- The CSV used in the app is already located in the data folder within the basic-streamlit-app folder.
