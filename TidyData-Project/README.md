### Sweeny TidyData Project: Travel Back in Time to the 2008 Olympics ###

Project Overview:
- The goal of this project is to showcase my ability to organize, tidy, manipulate, and control data.

Instructions:
- Step 1: Download the olympics_08_medalists csv from the TidyData-Project Folder.
- Step 2: Open VS Code and copy the code from the Jupyter Notebook in the TidyData-Project Folder.
- Step 3: Ensure that the csv is properly read into Python on VS code.
- Step 4: Run the code.
- Step 5: Compare the original untidy dataset with the tidy dataset.
- Dependencies: pandas, streamlit
  
Dataset Description:
- Initially, author Giorgio Comai put together a downloadable dataset which measured all medalist from the 2008 Olympics by their place of birth. This is interesting because one would likely assume that the country which an athlete represented in the Olympics was also the place where they were born. This is not always the case though because athletes who compete in the Olympics are still real people with their own unique background. For example, one Olympian from the U.S.A. could have grown up with a parent in the military and while their parent was stationed in France with the rest of the family, they were born. Or, an athlete could have parents from different countries and dual citizenship which permits them to compete and represent a country that they might not have necessarily been born in.
- This data was adapted from it's orginal source though and was made messy and untidy in a specific way in order to be cleaned and tidied in a comprehensible manner. Therefore, before processing the data I created code to make it read-able for my pc and any desired data manipulation purposes.
