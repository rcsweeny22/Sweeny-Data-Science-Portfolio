# Sweeny Machine Learning Streamlit App

### Project Overview:
- For this project I dove into KNN and the 


### Instructions:
- Step 1. Read all instructions - this app showcases KNN which is best used for classification tasks.
- Step 2. Navigate to the top of the app and find the 4 tabs.
- Step 3. After reading the 'General App Information,' select the 'User Input' tab.
- Step 4. Choose the number of k neighbors and the data type. Select a Seaborn dataset or upload a csv.file. Choose features and a target variable.
- Step 5. Navigate to the 'Model Accuracy' tab and explore.
- Step 6. Go to the last tab, 'Additional Data Information.'
- Step 7. Alter the data type and features to see how the accuracy of the model changes.


### Dataset Descriptions:
- 🛳️The Titanic Seaborn dataset has information about passengers on the Titanic. Variables include age, sex, fare, ticket class, survival status, embarkation port, number of siblings/spouses, and number of a passenger's parents/children on the Titanic. This dataset can be very interesting and helpful to explore, especially when using 'survived' as the target variable.
- 🐧The Penguins dataset is also from Seaborn. It offers helpful data for classification models with its features such as species, island, bill length, bill depth, flipper length, body mass, and sex. You can use the numeric features with a categorical target variable such as species or island to create a model that is able to classify data well!
- 🚗:The Taxi dataset is another Seaborn dataset and it's features include pickup and dropoff date, number of passengers, distance traveled, fare, tip, tolls, total payment, color of taxi, and payment method for taxi rides in a specified time frame. Use different data types to analyze this dataset!
- You can also upload your own dataset and interract with it in this app!


### Results:
- Results will vary based on user selections.
