# Sweeny-Data-Science-Portfolio
 - This is my Data Science Portfolio where I will store the visualizations, models, and projects I complete in my _Introduction to Data Science_ course this spring semester at Notre Dame.
 - This portfolio provides a window into my technical data sceince skills and showcases my creativity.
 - As a student new to coding, this portfolio will be one of my first big steps into the world of Data Science.
