# Sweeny-Data-Science-Portfolio
 - This is my Data Science Portfolio where I will store the visualizations, models, and projects I complete in my _Introduction to Data Science_ course this spring semester at Notre Dame. This portfolio provides a window into my technical data sceince skills and showcases my creativity. As a student new to coding, this portfolio will be one of my first big steps into the world of Data Science.

## Project 1- Creating my first Streamlit App!
#### Come try my new [penguin streamlit app](https://github.com/rcsweeny22/Sweeny-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/basic-streamlit-app)!

#### Update:
- For this project I wanted to create an interractive app where users could engage with my code in a fun way! This is a great app for children and those interested in wildlife because it compares different species, sizes, and island of penguins. 

## Project 2- A Tidy Data Project: Taking a Jump Back to the 2008 Olympics
#### Check out my [Tidy Data Project](https://github.com/rcsweeny22/Sweeny-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/TidyData-Project)!

#### Overview:
-  In this project you will be able to enagage with messy data about the 2008 Olympic Games and learn how to organize and clean the data in order to make it read-able for a computer. Sometimes, code that makes sense to us confuses programs which need data in a precise and organized fashion. All variables must be in their own column and all observations in their own row.

#### Relationship:
- This Tidy Data Project adds a lot of depth to my overall coding portfolio because it allows me to showcase my skills for manipulating and cleaning a dataset, which is a job that many data analysts are tasked with in the real world. Often tidying data can be the bulk of the work a data analyst or scientist has to accomplish so even though my previous projects which focus on analyzing data are important, this fundamental data work is absoluetly crucial for a data scientist. Data in the real world is not going to come in a neat, read-able format, so I have the responsibility of manipulating and tidying the messy real life information.
