# Sweeny-Data-Science-Portfolio :briefcase:
 - This is my Data Science Portfolio where I will store the visualizations, models, and projects I complete in my _Introduction to Data Science_ course this spring semester at Notre Dame. This portfolio provides a window into my technical data sceince skills and showcases my creativity. As a student new to coding, this portfolio will be one of my first big steps into the world of Data Science.
>[!IMPORTANT]
>The **technical skills** I have showcased in these four projects include: **EDA, Pandas, Streamlit, Python, TidyData principles, Seaborn, Supervised Machine Learning, KNN, SKLearn, Unsupervised Machine Learning, and K-Means Clustering.**

## At a Glance:
 - Project 1: [Penguin Streamlit App](https://github.com/rcsweeny22/Sweeny-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/basic-streamlit-app)
   * This basic streamlit app allows users to interract with Seaborn's penguin dataset through an exploratory data analysis.       
 - Project 2: [Tidy Data Project](https://github.com/rcsweeny22/Sweeny-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/TidyData-Project)
   * This project focuses on cleaning and tidying a messy dataset about the events, medals, and names of 2008 Olympians.
 - Project 3: [K-Nearest Neighbors App](https://sweeny-data-science-portfolio-cu5pwrtpvbf7habq472ote.streamlit.app/)
   * This app is shareable and explores K-Nearest Neighbors, a form of Supervised Machine Learning that classifies data.
 - Project 4: [K-Means Clustering App](https://sweeny-data-science-portfolio-9fedggdxehs36qbisvcsag.streamlit.app/)
   * This app is also public and dives into K-Means Clustering, a form of Unsupervised Machine Learning, helping to preprocesses data.

## Project 1- Creating my first Streamlit App! :penguin:
### Come try my new [penguin streamlit app](https://github.com/rcsweeny22/Sweeny-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/basic-streamlit-app)!
>[!IMPORTANT]
>**Skills showcased**: EDA, Pandas, Streamlit, Python

### 	üñ•Ô∏è: Overview:
- For this project I wanted to create an interractive app where users could engage with my code in a fun way! This is a great app for children and those interested in wildlife because it compares different species, sizes, and island of penguins.
- I coded select boxes so users could filter penguins by island and also sliders so users could enagage with the bill and flipper length of the different penguin species.

### 	:bulb: Relationship:
- In order to understand the importance of Unsupervised and Supervised Machine Learning practices, this project gave me the opportunity to create an Exploratory Data Analysis. While analyzing data is fun, there are a lot of steps beforehand that are necessary if one wants to manipulate and investigate data through an EDA. This project allowed me to have a better appreciation for the preprocessing steps while also exposing me to the basics of creating an app. I was able to use this Streamlit app knowledge more in my third and fourth projects.
  
## Project 2- Tidy Data Project: Jump Back to the 2008 Olympics! üèä
### Check out my [Tidy Data Project](https://github.com/rcsweeny22/Sweeny-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/TidyData-Project)!
>[!IMPORTANT]
>**Skills showcased**: TidyData principles, Seaborn, Python

### :desktop_computer: Overview:
-  In this project you will be able to enagage with messy data about the 2008 Olympic Games and learn how to organize and clean the data in order to make it read-able for a computer. Sometimes, code that makes sense to us confuses programs which need data in a precise and organized fashion. All variables must be in their own column and all observations in their own row.
-  I work through tidy data principles and utilize functions like pd.melt and dropna(subset=) in order to properly clean the messy 2008 Olympics dataset.

### 	:bulb: Relationship:
- This Tidy Data Project adds a lot of depth to my overall coding portfolio because it allows me to showcase my skills for manipulating and cleaning a dataset, which is a job that many data analysts are tasked with in the real world. Often tidying data can be the bulk of the work a data analyst or scientist has to accomplish so in order to eventually work on analyzing data which is also important, this fundamental data work of tidying is absoluetly crucial. Data in the real world is not going to come in a neat, read-able format, so we have the responsibility of manipulating and tidying the messy and real information.

## Project 3 - Machine Learning: [My k Nearest-Neighbors App](https://github.com/rcsweeny22/Sweeny-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/MLStreamlitApp) :calling:
### Send this [link](https://sweeny-data-science-portfolio-cu5pwrtpvbf7habq472ote.streamlit.app/) to family and friends and spread the Classification Model love!
>[!IMPORTANT]
>**Skills showcased**: KNN, Pandas, Streamlit, Supervised Machine Learning

### üñ•Ô∏è Overview:
- In this project I created a Streamlit app that is accessible to anyone who uses this [link](https://sweeny-data-science-portfolio-cu5pwrtpvbf7habq472ote.streamlit.app/). By using either a pre-loaded Seaborn dataset such as Titanic, Penguins, or Taxis, or uploading your own csv.file, users are able to explore the different dimensions of K Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
- KNN is a form of machine learning that is used with classification models. KNN allows you to classify new data points based off of the identitiy of a certain number of (k) nearby data points or 'neighbors.'
- By looking at the accuracy and F1-scores, the KNN classification model can be analyzed. Confusion matrices are also shown for users to visualize the data that was classified correctly and falsely by the trained KNN model. Users can also switch between scaled and unscaled data to see how that imapcts accuracy scores.

### üí°Relationship: 
- As a third update to my portfolio, this project was a great way to continue on my journey learning the foundations of data science. This Streamlit App is much more complex than my previous work, but also more accessible. Hopefully by building off of my previous app experience and tidy data skills, this app makes logistic regression, specifically classification with KNN, more exciting for users!

## Project 4 - Unsupervised Machine Learning: [My K-Means Clustering App](https://github.com/rcsweeny22/Sweeny-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/MLUnsupervisedApp) üí†
### Use this [link](https://sweeny-data-science-portfolio-9fedggdxehs36qbisvcsag.streamlit.app/) and send it to your friends or any Data Science lover!
>[!IMPORTANT]
>**Skills showcased**: K-Means Clustering, Streamlit, Unsupervised Machine Learning

### üñ•Ô∏è Overview:
- This project features an interractive Unsupervised Machine Learning application that allows users to explore the functions of K-Means Clustering. You can check out the project at this [link](https://sweeny-data-science-portfolio-9fedggdxehs36qbisvcsag.streamlit.app/)! Users are encouraged to select a preloaded Seaborn dataset or to upload their own.
- K-Means is a form of clustering that groups points of data together in k number of clusters. It finds the optimal centroid for the k number of clusters and consequently might reveal some helpful information. K-Means Clustering is used to find unclear patterns in unlabeled data, to categorize subgroups within large unlabeled datasets, and as a beginning step to further data analysis.

### üí°Relationship: 
- As the final project in my portfolio, this project was a great way to conclude my journey through the foundations of data science. This Streamlit App really allowed me to use my initial Streamlit skills from the first project, organize and preprocess my data like my second project taught me, and make a nice companion app for my third project. This project is the culmination of a lot of newfound knowledge and will hopefully help others to better understand Unsupervised Machine Learning.
