# Sweeny-Data-Science-Portfolio :briefcase:
 - This is my Data Science Portfolio where I will store the visualizations, models, and projects I complete in my _Introduction to Data Science_ course this spring semester at Notre Dame. This portfolio provides a window into my technical data sceince skills and showcases my creativity. As a student new to coding, this portfolio will be one of my first big steps into the world of Data Science.

## Project 1- Creating my first Streamlit App! :penguin:
### Come try my new [penguin streamlit app](https://github.com/rcsweeny22/Sweeny-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/basic-streamlit-app)!

### 	üñ•Ô∏è: Overview:
- For this project I wanted to create an interractive app where users could engage with my code in a fun way! This is a great app for children and those interested in wildlife because it compares different species, sizes, and island of penguins.
- I coded select boxes so users could filter penguins by island and also sliders so users could enagage with the bill and flipper length of the different penguin species. 

## Project 2- Tidy Data Project: Jump Back to the 2008 Olympics! üèä
### Check out my [Tidy Data Project](https://github.com/rcsweeny22/Sweeny-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/TidyData-Project)!

### :desktop_computer: Overview:
-  In this project you will be able to enagage with messy data about the 2008 Olympic Games and learn how to organize and clean the data in order to make it read-able for a computer. Sometimes, code that makes sense to us confuses programs which need data in a precise and organized fashion. All variables must be in their own column and all observations in their own row.
-  I work through tidy data principles and utilize functions like pd.melt and dropna(subset=) in order to properly clean the messy 2008 Olympics dataset.

### 	:bulb: Relationship:
- This Tidy Data Project adds a lot of depth to my overall coding portfolio because it allows me to showcase my skills for manipulating and cleaning a dataset, which is a job that many data analysts are tasked with in the real world. Often tidying data can be the bulk of the work a data analyst or scientist has to accomplish so in order to eventually work on analyzing data which is also important, this fundamental data work of tidying is absoluetly crucial. Data in the real world is not going to come in a neat, read-able format, so we have the responsibility of manipulating and tidying the messy and real information.

## Project 3 - Machine Learning Application: KNN :calling:
### Send this link[] to family and friends and spread the Classification Model love!

### üñ•Ô∏è Overview:
- In this project I created a Streamlit app that is accessible to anyone who uses this <link>. By using either a pre-loaded Seaborn dataset such as Titanic, Penguins, or Taxis, or uploading your own csv.file, users are able to explore the different dimensions of K Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
- KNN is a form of machine learning that is used with classification models. KNN allows you to classify new data points based off of the identitiy of a certain number of (k) nearby data points or 'neighbors.'
- By looking at the accuracy and F1-scores, the KNN classification model can be analyzed. Confusion matrices are also shown for users to visualize the data that was classified correctly and falsely by the trained KNN model. Users can also switch between scaled and unscaled data to see how that imapcts accuracy scores.

#### KNN Visual:

### üí°Relationship: 
- As a third update to my portfolio, this project was a great way to continue on my journey learning the foundations of data science. This Streamlit App is much more complex than my previous work, but also more accessible. Hopefully by building off of my previous app experience and tidy data skills, this app makes logistic regression, specifically classification with KNN, more exciting for users!
